# Learning material

## ANNs

You should get familiar with the basics of ANNs: neurons, layers, back propagation, activation functions, etc. For this, see for example:

https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf

You may also want for example to read the introduction in this paper:

https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/58552/2/ArticlePIVANN.pdf

an to follow the links related to ANNs given in the *Introduction*, pages 1 and 2.

You can also find a brief introduction and a few articles that are worth reading in this pdf, slides 9 - 13:

## DRL

Once you understand the basics of ANNs, you should get familiar with Reinforcement Learning. For this, I recommend that you first look at videos on internet. Reading articles without having a high-level overview of the algorithms can be quite challenging. For some introduction videos, I recommend (and you should follow the suggested links if you need more material):

After you understand the main lines of the videos, you can have a look at the lecture pdf, slides 29 - 37:

And you can now read some of the papers in the field, both our own and its high level introduction, and the more technical literature:
